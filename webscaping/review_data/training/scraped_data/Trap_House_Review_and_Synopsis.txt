While watching Dave Bautista in Trap House, a memory popped into my head of seeing Roger Ebert and Gene Siskel on The Late Show with David Letterman (or possibly Late Night with David Letterman on NBC). It was the moment when Mr. Ebert described the Michael Douglas and Melanie Griffith film Shining Through as “Working Girl goes to war,” and “it worked.”

Why? Because Trap House is basically Spy Kids: DEA, and, surprisingly, like the godfather of film criticism once said, it works. (To be fair, Mr. Ebert gave up on the World War II film well into the third act.) Trap House takes some real chances, is genuinely enjoyable, and features several exciting action sequences, all set against a warm message about fathers and sons.

The story follows a pair of DEA agents, Ray (Dave Bautista) and Andre (Bobby Cannavale), who work the front lines of the drug trade at the El Paso, Texas, border. They cover their faces while on assignment because the cartels would pay handsomely for their identities, even going so far as to keep their children’s names hidden. Ray has a son, Cody (Avatar: The Way of Water’s Jack Champion).

Ray is a widower, and his cover is that he owns a construction business. He leads a group of five agents, and they recently lost one during an operation. In an engaging scene, we see one of the agents’ kids, Jesse (Blu del Barrio), receive the news at school, where all the children hold their breath, hoping their mom or dad survived the mission.

Jesse now has to move away, since the DEA refuses to take care of their fallen own. However, Cody decides to take matters into his own hands by robbing the cartel and planning to give the money to Jesse’s mom so they can stay in the area. Of course, when the head of the cartel (Tony Dalton) finds out, he activates a secret weapon (Kate del Castillo) to track down the robbers and uncover the identities of the task force to end things for good.

Trap House is directed by Michael Dowse, whose filmography is marked by wild swings that often miss the mark. However, his latest is easily his best since the cult-classic hockey comedy Goon. Working from a script by Gary Scott Thompson, best known for his story credits on the first two chapters of the never-ending Fast & Furious franchise, the movie moves propulsively.

Bautista is too lightweight an actor to carry any film, even one as frivolous as this. However, I did enjoy the gentle-giant DEA agent and dad he plays here, swinging a feather-light hand rather than one wielding a mallet. Especially in the quieter scenes. The film refuses to fall into standard father-son tropes and clichés, no matter how ridiculous the situation the kids find themselves in.

I mentioned above that the script does take some risks. For instance, having the core group of teenage characters form a support system together, knowing their parents are undercover drug enforcement officers, is refreshing. Then, presenting plausible scenarios in which they gain privileged intel, equipment, and skill sets feels believable enough not to disrupt your mild enjoyment.

Is Trap House worth watching?

The script has a mild third-act plot twist that many will see coming. However, there is a second part to this, let’s call it a plot pivot, that no matter how ludicrous, works within the world Trap House creates. I mean, if the kids of DEA agents can rob for the greater good, then the final twenty-minute plot point, no spoilers, manages to work surprisingly well.

Trap House is worth watching despite some flaws. The film has a kinetic energy that moves briskly, but when it comes to the cover being blown, the script is too flimsy to hide a few noticeable plot holes. The ending also wraps up a little too neatly, leaving an opening for a sequel, which is a personal pet peeve of mine.

However, as a harmless, action-packed one-off with heart, Bautista’s film is a pleasant surprise for anyone who enjoys this low-rent genre picture.

You can watch Trap House only in theaters starting November 14th!

Alright
M.N. Miller
Trap House is a flawed yet surprisingly engaging action film with a warm father-son core. While the script is thin and the twists stretch plausibility, the energy, risks, and teen-driven plot keep it entertaining. Bautista and the young cast help make this low-rent genre entry worth a watch.
